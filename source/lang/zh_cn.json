The protocol was originally named Jabber, and was developed by the Jabber open-source community in 1999 for near real-time, instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance. Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash; <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP'>Wikipedia</a></p>",

However&mdash;like anyone else&mdash;I still need to pay my rent and buy food, and this project doesn't generate any income. This is where you can help.</p><p>If you would like to support PRISM Break, please consider donating Bitcoin to fund future development. I suggest at least 0.05 BTC, but any amount is appreciated. If you donate 0.50 BTC or more and leave a name, I will add you to this page as a PRISM Break sponsor.</p><p>Donate address:<br /><strong>1NAfx5GEZHR8t69LjxTeShPP4XXaxeUqQw</strong></p><p>I appreciate your support.</p><p>Peng Zhong<br />PRISM Break developer</p><p>P.S.
