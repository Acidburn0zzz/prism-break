The protocol was originally named Jabber, and was developed by the Jabber open-source community in 1999 for near real-time, instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance. Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash; <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP'>Wikipedia</a></p>",
