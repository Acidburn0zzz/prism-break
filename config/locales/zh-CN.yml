Since launch, nearly 750,000 privacy-conscious visitors have viewed the site over one million times around the world.</p><p>While the first version of prism-break.org took only two days to build and launch, maintaining and improving the site over the past two months has taken up much of my time. As of August 3rd, 2013, I've pushed 1,208 edits to the site and spent hundreds of hours poring over privacy resources. I've made this effort in order to ensure that PRISM Break offers you the best methods to combat government surveillance.</p><p>With so many people visiting prism-break.org, I would love to devote my full attention to fixing possible security bugs, improving the projects list and making the content more user-friendly. However&mdash;like anyone else&mdash;I still need to pay my rent and buy food, and this project doesn't generate any income. This is where you can help.</p><p>If you would like to support PRISM Break, please consider donating Bitcoin to fund future development. I suggest at least 0.05 BTC, but any amount is appreciated. If you donate 0.50 BTC or more and leave a name, I will add you to this page as a PRISM Break sponsor.</p><p>Donate address:<br /><strong>1NAfx5GEZHR8t69LjxTeShPP4XXaxeUqQw</strong></p><p>I appreciate your support.</p><p>Peng Zhong<br />PRISM Break developer</p><p>P.S. The developers of the fine projects listed on <a href='https://prism-break.org'>PRISM Break</a> would also be grateful for your support. If you enjoy using their app, seriously consider throwing som} mo}ey their way to fund development.</p>"
