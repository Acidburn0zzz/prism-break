Make sure to check for HTTPS before signing in to a website through Tor. Signing into HTTP websites can result in your ID being captured by a Tor exit node.</p><p><strong>Firefox</strong> notes: This browser uses Google search by default: replace it with a more <a href='#web-search'>private alternative</a>.
