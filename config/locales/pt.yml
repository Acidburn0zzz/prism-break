  title: "Opt out of PRISM, the NSA&rsquo;s global data surveillance program - PRISM Break"
  meta-description: "Opt out of PRISM, the NSA&rsquo;s global data surveillance program. Stop reporting your online activities to the American government with these free alternatives to proprietary software."
  intro: "<strong>Diga não ao PRISM, o programa mundial de vigilância de dados da NSA.</strong> Pare de reportar suas atividades online para o governo americano; use as seguintes alternativas livres ao software proprietário."

  operating-system-note: "<p>Apple, Google, and Microsoft are a part of PRISM. Their proprietary operating systems cannot be trusted to safeguard your personal information from the NSA.</p><p>This leaves us with two free alternatives: <strong><a href='https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html'>GNU/Linux</a></strong> and <strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BSD_operating_systems'>BSD</a></strong>.</p> <p>GNU/Linux has a much larger community to help you with the transition. It's recommended that you begin your explorations by looking for a <a href='http://distrowatch.com/'>GNU/Linux distribution</a> that suits your needs.</p> <p>Why not Ubuntu? Ubuntu is a poor choice because it contains <a href='https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.html'>spyware</a>.</p> <p>Note: PRISM Break recommends the no-codecs edition of <strong>Linux Mint</strong>, as the other editions are encumbered with software patents. <a href='https://github.com/nylira/prism-break/issues/126#issuecomment-19898104'>More info</a>.</p>"
