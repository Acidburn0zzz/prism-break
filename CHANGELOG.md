0.2.0

# Notable Additions

* Split the site into over 100 pages for easier linking and saner translations.

* Split the translation files into (at least) two parts. The first part for project descriptions and the second part for general site translations.

* Add in-depth information about each project, including source code, license, security notes, and longer descriptions powered by Wikipedia.

* Due the change above, Project URLs, logos, and even names can now be localized.

# Notable Removals

* Remove client-side dependency for JavaScript for better security and usability with NoScript.

* Remove most category notes. The legacy category notes are confusing and completely unorganized. With 0.2.0 the vast majority of the notes should be moved into their respective projects. I need your help to splice the legacy category notes into the new project notes!

# Project Additions

* Add Litecoin.

# Project Removals

* Remove IceDove due to the fact it's lagging behind in security patches compared to Firefox and even Tor Browser Bundle. 

* Remove Noblogs.org since it's redundant with a properly categorized A/I.

* Remove 'List of cryptocurrencies' for now. Will be added later with category notes.
