0.2.0

# Notable Additions

* Split the site into over 100 pages for easier linking and saner translations.

* Add indepth information about each project, including source code, license, security notes, and longer descriptions powered by Wikipedia.

# Notable Removals

* Remove client-side dependency for JavaScript for better security and usability with NoScript.

* Remove category notes. The legacy category notes are confusing and completely unorganized. With 0.2.0 the vast majority of the notes should be moved into their respective project's notes. Unfortunately, this is not doable easily programatically. I need your help to splice the legacy category notes into the new project notes I've already done this with the English edition.

# Project Additions

* Add Litecoin.

# Project Removals

* Remove IceDove due to the fact it's lagging behind in security patches compared to Firefox and even Tor Browser Bundle. 

* Remove Noblogs.org since it's redundant with a properly categorized A/I.

* Remove 'List of cryptocurrencies' for now. Will be added later with category notes.
